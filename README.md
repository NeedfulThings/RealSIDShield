RealSIDShield
=============

An Arduino shield that makes it easy to use a MOS Technology 6581/8580 SID chip (the famous C64 sound chip)

I'm still waiting for the PCBs to return from the factory in China. This repository will then be updated with schematics,
the board file, a BOM and the actual gerbers I used for production. But not before I can verify that the PCB design is
correct.
